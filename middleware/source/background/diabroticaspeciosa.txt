Diabrotica speciosa, commonly known as the Cucurbit beetle, is a species of beetle that is a primary pest of soybean arthropods. Eggs are laid in the soil near the base of a host plant, and larvae tend to congregate in the upper 10 cm of the root under the crown, causing significant damage to the plants. The species undergoes three larval instars and has a pupal stage that lasts for six days at 25Â°C. Adults are typically green, and their length ranges from 5.5 to 7.3 mm. Control of Diabrotica speciosa typically involves the use of insecticides and crop rotation.
