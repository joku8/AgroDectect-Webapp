Northern Corn Leaf Blight is a plant disease caused by the fungus Setosphaeria turcica. Symptoms include cigar-shaped gray to green lesions, varying in size depending on the resistance of the corn hybrid to the pathogen. The disease occurs during or after silking and thrives in warm, moist conditions. Resistant hybrids and fungicides during early stages of the disease can help manage the disease.
