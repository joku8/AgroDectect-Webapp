Gray Leaf Spot is a disease caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis that affects only corn. Symptoms include small necrotic spots that become rectangular, gray lesions with distinct parallel edges. The disease occurs from silking to maturity and is favored by moderate to warm temperatures, extended periods of high humidity or wet weather, and minimum tillage. Management options include using resistant corn hybrids, conventional tillage, crop rotation, and foliar fungicides if economically warranted.
