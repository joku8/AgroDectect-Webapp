Soybean crops are susceptible to caterpillar pests, particularly velvetbean caterpillars, loopers, and corn earworms. These pests can damage soybean leaves and pods, reducing the plant's ability to produce food and fill the pods. The threshold for treatment varies depending on the pest and ranges from 8 worms per foot of row for velvetbean caterpillars to 150 worms per 100 sweeps of a sweep net for loopers. Various insecticides are effective for controlling these pests, and scouting should continue until the soybean pods have filled and reached maturity. Always follow label directions and restrictions when applying pesticides.
