Common Rust is a plant disease caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. Symptoms include oval to circular red to dark brown pustules on both leaf surfaces, which can lead to leaf chlorosis or death. The disease occurs in June or July when wind-carried urediniospores are introduced into the corn belt. Cool temperatures, heavy dews, and high humidity favor the disease. Resistant corn hybrids and early application of fungicides can help manage the disease.
